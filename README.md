============

I've ported this software to the mks dlc32 board.   I've largely abandoned this ... it seems to make more sense to run Fluidnc on the mksdlc32 and use a Raspberry pi as the controller.   This is a much easier development path, as you can leverage the open source linux and the open source fluidnc.
